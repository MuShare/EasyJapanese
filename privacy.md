## Privacy Policy

Privacy and data protection are important to the Easy Japanese. 
Transparency is, too. 
We’ve done our best to cut through the legal jargon and explain in simple terms what information we collect about you, 
what we use it for, and the few situations in which we share it with others.

Please read this privacy policy carefully. It applies to all interactions you have with **Easy Japanese's app**.

## Information we collect
**Easy Japanese** collects anonymous statistics such as crash reports and feature usage. 
These are used to track app health and plan future features.

## Analytics

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support. 
We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish **Easy Japanese**’s functionality.
We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties. 
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements;
to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies;
or to protect our rights and property. 
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. 
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
